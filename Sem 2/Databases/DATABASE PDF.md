To trace the execution of the given sequence of lock requests, you need to follow the order of the requests and determine whether each request is granted or not, and if any transaction releases locks. Here is the sequence provided in the image:

```
T1.lockX(C) → T2.lockX(D) → T1.lockS(D) → T4.lockS(A) → T4.lockX(D) → T1.lockS(A) → T2.lockX(B) → T4.lockS(B) → T2.rel(D) → T3.lockS(C) → T3.lockS(B)
```

Let's go through each step and fill in the table:

1. **T1.lockX(C)**: T1 requests an exclusive lock on C.
   - **Granted**: Yes, because no other transaction holds a lock on C.
   - **Transaction**: T1

2. **T2.lockX(D)**: T2 requests an exclusive lock on D.
   - **Granted**: Yes, because no other transaction holds a lock on D.
   - **Transaction**: T2

3. **T1.lockS(D)**: T1 requests a shared lock on D.
   - **Granted**: No, because T2 holds an exclusive lock on D.
   - **Transaction**: T1 (waits)

4. **T4.lockS(A)**: T4 requests a shared lock on A.
   - **Granted**: Yes, because no other transaction holds a lock on A.
   - **Transaction**: T4

5. **T4.lockX(D)**: T4 requests an exclusive lock on D.
   - **Granted**: No, because T2 holds an exclusive lock on D.
   - **Transaction**: T4 (waits)

6. **T1.lockS(A)**: T1 requests a shared lock on A.
   - **Granted**: Yes, because T4 holds a shared lock on A, and shared locks are compatible.
   - **Transaction**: T1

7. **T2.lockX(B)**: T2 requests an exclusive lock on B.
   - **Granted**: Yes, because no other transaction holds a lock on B.
   - **Transaction**: T2

8. **T4.lockS(B)**: T4 requests a shared lock on B.
   - **Granted**: No, because T2 holds an exclusive lock on B.
   - **Transaction**: T4 (waits)

9. **T2.rel(D)**: T2 releases the lock on D.
   - **Granted**: N/A (release operation)
   - **Transaction**: T2

10. **T3.lockS(C)**: T3 requests a shared lock on C.
    - **Granted**: No, because T1 holds an exclusive lock on C.
    - **Transaction**: T3 (waits)

11. **T3.lockS(B)**: T3 requests a shared lock on B.
    - **Granted**: No, because T2 holds an exclusive lock on B.
    - **Transaction**: T3 (waits)

Now, let's fill in the table based on the above analysis:

| Step | Request       | Granted | Transaction |
|------|---------------|---------|-------------|
| 1    | T1.lockX(C)   | Yes     | T1          |
| 2    | T2.lockX(D)   | Yes     | T2          |
| 3    | T1.lockS(D)   | No      | T1 (waits)  |
| 4    | T4.lockS(A)   | Yes     | T4          |
| 5    | T4.lockX(D)   | No      | T4 (waits)  |
| 6    | T1.lockS(A)   | Yes     | T1          |
| 7    | T2.lockX(B)   | Yes     | T2          |
| 8    | T4.lockS(B)   | No      | T4 (waits)  |
| 9    | T2.rel(D)     | N/A     | T2          |
| 10   | T3.lockS(C)   | No      | T3 (waits)  |
| 11   | T3.lockS(B)   | No      | T3 (waits)  |

This table shows the sequence of lock requests, whether they are granted, and the state of the transactions immediately after each request.

## SQL

To solve the query optimization problem, we need to follow a structured approach. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Understand the Relational Model
The given relational model consists of the following tables:
- **Professor(PID, Name)**
- **Student(SID, Name)**
- **Lecture(LID, Name, GivenBy)**
- **Attend(LID, SID)**
- **Exam(LID, SID, Note)**

### Step 2: Identify the Query Requirements
The query asks us to find all students who passed the Database class given by Prof. Gambi. To achieve this, we need to:
1. Identify the professor named "Prof. Gambi".
2. Find the lectures given by this professor.
3. Identify the students who attended these lectures.
4. Check if these students passed the exam for these lectures.

### Step 3: Write the Canonical Form of the Query
The canonical form of the query involves joining the relevant tables and applying the necessary conditions. Here is the SQL query in its canonical form:

```sql
SELECT S.Name
FROM Student S
JOIN Attend A ON S.SID = A.SID
JOIN Lecture L ON A.LID = L.LID
JOIN Professor P ON L.GivenBy = P.PID
JOIN Exam E ON S.SID = E.SID AND L.LID = E.LID
WHERE P.Name = 'Prof. Gambi' AND L.Name = 'Database' AND E.Note >= 50;
```

### Step 4: Optimize the Query
To optimize the query, we can follow these steps:

1. **Use Indexes**: Ensure that there are indexes on the columns used in the joins and the WHERE clause. For example, indexes on `Professor(Name)`, `Lecture(GivenBy)`, `Lecture(Name)`, `Attend(LID, SID)`, `Exam(LID, SID)`, and `Exam(Note)`.

2. **Reduce the Number of Joins**: If possible, reduce the number of joins by filtering early. For instance, filter the lectures and professors before joining with the other tables.

3. **Use Subqueries**: Use subqueries to filter data before performing joins.

Here is the optimized query:

```sql
SELECT S.Name
FROM Student S
JOIN (
    SELECT A.SID, L.LID
    FROM Attend A
    JOIN Lecture L ON A.LID = L.LID
    JOIN Professor P ON L.GivenBy = P.PID
    WHERE P.Name = 'Prof. Gambi' AND L.Name = 'Database'
) AS FilteredLectures ON S.SID = FilteredLectures.SID
JOIN Exam E ON FilteredLectures.SID = E.SID AND FilteredLectures.LID = E.LID
WHERE E.Note >= 50;
```

### Explanation of Optimization Steps
1. **Subquery for Filtering**: The subquery `FilteredLectures` filters the lectures given by "Prof. Gambi" and the "Database" class before joining with the `Student` and `Exam` tables. This reduces the number of rows processed in the subsequent joins.
2. **Indexes**: Ensure that indexes are created on the columns used in the joins and the WHERE clause to speed up the query execution.
3. **Join Order**: The join order is chosen to filter the data as early as possible, reducing the number of rows in intermediate results.

By following these steps, the query is optimized to retrieve the desired information efficiently.
