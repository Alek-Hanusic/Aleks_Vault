```

```
b) (D∧L)⇔(S∧I)
```

```
c) (D∧L)⇒A
```

## Exercise 1.3 (Score: 5)

Construct a truth table for the formula (¬P∨Q)∧(¬(P∧ ¬Q)). Make a
column for each significant subformula to improve comprehensibility (i.e., the
truth table must have more than three columns).

## Exercise 1.4 (Score: 5)

Familiarise yourself with the logical equivalences shown in the lecture and prove
at least three of them (each involving at least two variables,αandβ) by con-
structing truth tables. Make a column for each significant subformula to improve
comprehensibility.

(^1) Hint:“Unless” is to be understood as “if not” here.
