## File Transfer Application Proposal

**Summary:**
The file transfer application will aim to provide a secure and efficient way for users to transfer files between devices. Each user will have the ability to receive and send files.

**Main Features:**
1. Authentication codes (to link sender)
2. File upload and download functionality
3. File management (rename, delete, move)
4. Secure file transfer using encryption
5. User-friendly interface for easy navigation
6. Real-time progress tracking for file transfers

**Networking Features and Database Usage:**
- Networking: The application will utilize TCP/IP sockets for establishing connections between the client and server for file transfer. It will implement secure protocols like SSL/TLS for encrypted communication.
- Database: The database will store user account information (username, password), file metadata (file name, size, owner), and access control permissions. It will use a relational database like SQLite or MySQL to manage this data efficiently.

**External Libraries:**
1. Flask: For building the web application and handling HTTP requests.
2. SQLAlchemy: To interact with the database and manage data persistence.
3. Socket programming in Python: For implementing networking features like establishing connections and transferring files securely.
4. Bootstrap: For designing a responsive and user-friendly interface.
