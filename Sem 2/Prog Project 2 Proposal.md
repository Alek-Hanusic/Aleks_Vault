## File Transfer Application Proposal

**Summary:**
The file transfer application will aim to provide a secure and efficient way for users to transfer files between devices. Each user will have the ability to receive and send files.

**Main Features:**
1. Authentication codes (to link sender & receiver)
2. File upload (send) and download (receive) functionality
3. User-friendly interface for easy navigation
4. Secure file transfer using encryption
5. Real-time progress tracking for file transfers

**Networking Features and Database Usage:**
- Networking: The application will utilize TCP/IP sockets for establishing connections between the client and server for file transfer. Depending on the difficulty to implement, it might also include secure protocols like SSL/TLS for encrypted communication.
- Database: The database will store user information, file metadata (file name, size, owner), and the history of file transfers. It will use a relational database like SQLite or MySQL to manage this data efficiently.

**External Libraries:**
2. SQL - To interact with the database and manage data persistence.
3. Socket programming in Python: For implementing networking features like establishing connections and transferring files securely.
4. Tkinter/Streamlit: For designing a responsive and user-friendly interface.
