## Population vs Sample

>**Population** refers to the entire group of individuals about whom you wish to draw conclusions.Â 

>**The sample** refers to the group of people from which you will be collecting data.

## How to estimate f

### Only formula we need

`outcome = (model) + error`
## The mean

>The mean is the sum of all scores divided by the number of scores.

>The mean is also the value from which the (squared) scores deviate least (it has the least error).


## Fitting

>The ability of an algorithm to perform well on previously unobserved inputs is called generalization. The generalization error is defined as the expected value of the error on a new input.
