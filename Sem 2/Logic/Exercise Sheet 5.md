## 5.1
A parse tree is a tree-diagram that shows the structure of a specific string. It shows the syntax of the string, separated into the most basic parts. Similar to other tree diagrams, it is made up of root nodes that branch into leaf nodes. A parse tree is created by a parser, which is a component of a compiler that processes the source code and checks it for syntactic correctness.
