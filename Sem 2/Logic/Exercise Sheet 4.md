## Exercise 4.1
*Symbolize the following statements by propositional formulas.* 
*a) If the humidity is high, it will rain this afternoon or this evening.* 
*b) It requires courage and skills to climb that mountain.* 

*Provide appropriate natural-language definitions for all propositional symbols.*
### a)
HighHumidity = "Humidity is High"
AfternoonRain = "it will rain this afternoon"
EveningRain = "it will rain this evening"


>HighHumidity → (AfternoonRain ∨ EveningRain)

### b)
C = "it requires courage"
S = "it requires skills"
M = "climb that mountain"

> (C ∧ S) → M
