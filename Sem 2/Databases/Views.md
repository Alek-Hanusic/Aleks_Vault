A database view isÂ **a subset of a database and is based on a query that runs on one or more database tables**. Database views are saved in the database as named queries and can be used to save frequently used, complex queries.

*Simplified:* A view of a user is what data from the table the user can see. For example, only their username and password, while they do not see their USER ID or SIGNUP TIME.
