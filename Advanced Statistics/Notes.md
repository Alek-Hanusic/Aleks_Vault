## Population vs Sample

>**Population** refers to the entire group of individuals about whom you wish to draw conclusions. 

>**The sample** refers to the group of people from which you will be collecting data.

## How to estimate f

### Only formula we need

`outcome = (model) + error`
## The mean

>The mean is the sum of all scores divided by the number of scores.

>The mean is also the value from which the (squared) scores deviate least (it has the least error).

## Fitting

>The ability of an algorithm to perform well on previously unobserved inputs is called generalization. The generalization error is defined as the expected value of the error on a new input.

**Overfitting** =  building a model that is too complex for the amount of data that we have (low bias and high variance).

**Underfitting** =  building a model that is too simple given the complexity of the 
data (high bias and low variance).
## Important:
>The sum of squares, variance, and standard deviation represent the same thing:

- The ‘fit’ of the mean to the data
- The variability in the data
- How well the mean represents the observed data
- Error



## Test Statistic
