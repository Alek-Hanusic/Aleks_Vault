**Index**Â is used to quicken the search by reducing the number of records to search for.

# Clustered Index
The data is organized in a way that helps retrieve the data
ex: Phonebook, organized by the alphabet
# Nonclustered Index
A pointer towards the data
ex: Indexes at the end of a book
# Composite Index
Like a single index (Clustered Index), a composite index is also a data structure of records sorted on something. But unlike a single index, that something is not a field, but a concatenation of multiple fields.
