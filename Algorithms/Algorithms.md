# The  Random-Access Machine (RAM)

Algorithms can be measured in a machine-independent way using the Random Access Machine (RAM) model. This model assumes a single processor. In the RAM model, instructions are executed one after the other, with no concurrent operations. This model of computation is an abstraction that allows us to compare algorithms on the basis of performance. The assumptions made in the RAM model to accomplish this are

1. Each simple operation takes 1 time step.
2. Loops and subroutines are not simple operations.
3. Each memory access takes one time step, and there is no shortage of memory.

# Complexity
## Input size
We measure the complexity of an algorithm as a function of the size of the 
input 

## Worst-Case Complexity
